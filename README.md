# IHY
The project “IHY” (I Help You) is a personal project that I do. I did a similar project before as I was in my third year of college so I wanted to try it with a better script. The main function of this project is to help others and seek help from each other. I use Java (Spring Boot) as the Back-end and Flutter as the Front-end.
